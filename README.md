# MortalityDashboard
This dashboard takes the number of births in a 5-year period and progressively subtracts registered deaths from that cohort as they age.
Births are based on ONS population data for the 20th Century and 21st Century.
Deaths are based on the ONS mortality files for the 20th Century and 21st Century.
